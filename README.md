### Next.js Foundations

Welcome to the Next.js Foundations course! 
This beginner-friendly, example-led course will guide you through the prerequisite knowledge for Next.js. 
You will build a simple project step-by-step; starting with a JavaScript application, then migrating it to React and Next.js.

#### What is Next.js?
Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.
By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, integrations - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

Whether youâ€™re an individual developer or part of a larger team, you can leverage React and Next.js to build fully interactive, highly dynamic, and performant web applications.
